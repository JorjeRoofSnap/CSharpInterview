# Objective
The home page should display three lists of beer.

- The first list should be the raw data as it comes back from the api.
- The second list should be sorted by IBU
- The third list should be grouped by brand

You will likely want to start in the HomeController. There are `// TODO:` comments sprinkled throughout to help you on your way.

The home view is already implemented. You just need to make the data work.

# Result
The result should look something like this. The data from the api is random so your results will vary.
