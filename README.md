# Objective
The home page should display three lists of beer.

- The first list should be the raw data as it comes back from the api.
- The second list should be sorted by IBU
- The third list should be grouped by brand

You will likely want to start in the HomeController. There are `// TODO:` comments sprinkled throughout to help you on your way.

The home view is already implemented. You just need to make the data work.

You are free to refactor as you see fit. You are free to use any libraries you want. Just remember you only have an hour to finish.

# Result
The result should look something like this. The data from the api is random so your results will vary.

# Tests
If you have time, write unit tests for the things you think it makes sense to unit test. You can use any framework you are comfortable with.
